# Labyrinth
This is a small python project simulating the solving of a randomly generated labyrinth using different algorithms

## How to use
run the `__init__.py` file to start the  program

````bash
python3 __init__.py
````

Once the program is running, the following hotkeys are available

| Key | Action                                       |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|
| 1-9 | Select algorithm                             |
| r   | Reload labyrinth and restart search          |
| q   | Quit program                                 |
| f   | Toggle Fast-forward search (skip simulation) |

## Available Algorithms
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. A Star Search
